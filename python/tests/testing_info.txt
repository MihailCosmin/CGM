In folder python/tests/original_examples you can find: 

1: Example for CGM and CLEARCGM for pure vector graphic CGM:
techdraw.cgm
and
techdraw_cleartext.cgm

The cleartext version: techdraw_cleartext.cgm
was produced by the original C# library so we can trust the clear text is mostly correct

This should be used as a baseline to test the conversions done with python

2: Example for CGM and CLEARCGM with embedded raster image

ICN-AFGA08298XX-A-252001-A-D1131-00007-A-01-1.cgm
and
ICN-AFGA08298XX-A-252001-A-D1131-00007-A-01-1_cleartext.cgm

The cleartext version: ICN-AFGA08298XX-A-252001-A-D1131-00007-A-01-1_cleartext.cgm
was produced by the original C# library so we can trust the clear text is mostly correct,
but note that the original C# library wasn't correctly processing embedded raster images, so this has to be worked more

This should be used as a baseline to test the conversions done with python

All tests should be done and added in subfolders named from 00001 to 99999

Test Folder Organization
========================
Each test case goes in its own numbered folder:
- 00001/ - Reserved for initial development testing
- 00002/ - techdraw.cgm conversion test
- 00003/ - ICN file conversion test
- 00004/ - Future test case
- etc.

File Naming Convention
=====================
Output files MUST follow the pattern:
  {original_filename}_cleartext.CGM

Examples:
  techdraw.cgm          → techdraw_cleartext.CGM
  ICN-AFGA...01-1.cgm   → ICN-AFGA...01-1_cleartext.CGM

Running Conversions
==================
Basic usage:
  python3 main.py <input_binary.cgm> <output_folder/filename_cleartext.CGM>

Examples:
  python3 main.py tests/original_examples/techdraw.cgm tests/00002/techdraw_cleartext.CGM
  python3 main.py tests/original_examples/ICN-AFGA08298XX-A-252001-A-D1131-00007-A-01-1.cgm tests/00003/ICN-AFGA08298XX-A-252001-A-D1131-00007-A-01-1_cleartext.CGM

Comparing Results
================
Compare with C# baseline:
  diff -u original_examples/techdraw_clearText.cgm 00002/techdraw_cleartext.CGM | less

Count lines:
  wc -l original_examples/techdraw_clearText.cgm 00002/techdraw_cleartext.CGM

Check geometry commands:
  grep "LINE" original_examples/techdraw_clearText.cgm | wc -l
  grep "LINE" 00002/techdraw_cleartext.CGM | wc -l
